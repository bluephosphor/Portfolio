                        Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Jonny and I work on lots of various things! 
                        I've been writing code since I was 11 years old. Working on and off on various games,
                        websites, and other things for the sheer enjoyment of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays I've had the opportunity to sharpen those skills and I feel ready to take 
                        the next step in making a career out of this. This site will serve as a place
                        for me to showcase some of my favorite projects while sharing info about them
                        and insight into how they came together. Head over to the 
                        <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to check it out!
