A small interactive example of some smoothly animated expandable info cards that I did as a technical assessment. I used Svelte and it's built in transition funtionality for this. I really like the way that Svelte simplifies the process of adding simple and performant transitions to web pages and components, as this is an increasingly important component of user exerience design and implementation.
