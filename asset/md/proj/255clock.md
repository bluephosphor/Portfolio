This is one of my projects for FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certification. For this project they had me set up a '25 + 5 Clock'. Which, if you didn't know, is a nice way to monitor your working time while giving yourself regular incrimental breaks. Essentially how it works is that you set up a working 'session' length in minutes, and a break length as well, and then simply press start and the clock will cycle through those times. It was a great exercise in application state mechanics and JavaScript's timing functionality. 

Admittedly I didn't really use any libraries for this particular project. As I was conceptualizing it in my head I didn't feel the need considering the scope of this project and the fact that all of the DOM manipulation was very simple.

I also really appreciate this as a tool. I think it's a great idea for all of us to take time to remember to pace ourselves especially when we get extremely invested in a project or goal. It ends up being better not only for us but for the project itself in the end.
